kdebuild-1 was an EAPI used by the Gentoo KDE team and the Genkdesvn
project for various live ebuilds in overlays.

As support for this ebuild format has never been officially approved,
the support will phase out from the Paludis package manager.  To avoid
any troubles users need to take some steps to properly remove all
kdebuild-1 packages from their installation.

Users should verify that they have no kdebuild-1 packages installed. If
Paludis was built with the 'inquisitio' use flag enabled, you can use:

    $ inquisitio -K installed -k EAPI kdebuild-1

Otherwise, use:

    $ paludis -q '*/*::/[.EAPI=kdebuild-1]'

and, if any such packages are installed, they must be uninstalled
before Paludis is upgraded.
