Upgrading udev from 171 (or older) to 197 will require special attention:

- Remove udev-postmount from runlevels.

- The need of CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y in the kernel; need to verify the fstype for
  possible /dev line in /etc/fstab is devtmpfs (and not, for example, tmpfs)

- The case of predictable network interface names; if the file
  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules is being used for renaming
  network interface names to already existing names, then you need to
  read following bug[1] because it's no longer possible. This won't
  be a problem with the new predictable network interface name scheme[2].

- Support for older kernels than 2.6.39 is dropped. If you need older kernel
  we recommend you to look into sys-fs/eudev or use local overlay for keeping
  the old ebuild. Remember to also get the distfiles where the patchsets are.
  The upgrade into current stable version of gentoo-sources is recommended.

- The case of separate /usr; if it worked for you with 171 it will continue
  to work for you with 197. We still recommend initramfs with separate /usr
  mounting capabilities because you might need packages like sys-apps/kbd
  (keymaps in /usr) or net-wireless/bluez (possible keyboard) in early boot.

And read every message printed by the emerge of udev and udev-init-scripts
to ensure the system is in order before booting as this news item might
not be complete.

Apologies if this news came too late for you.
