-Wl,--as-needed has been added to the default profile's LDFLAGS.

This option optimizes the linking process, only linking binaries to
libraries that are truly needed. This way, fewer libraries are loaded
at runtime and fewer packages need to be rebuilt after library updates.

To take advantage of the new default you can either rebuild world now
or just allow the system to migrate incrementally as it updates.

Please note that setting LDFLAGS="<your flags>" in your make.conf will
override the profile defaults. If you want to add additional LDFLAGS
it is recommended to use LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} <your flags>" instead to
avoid this.
