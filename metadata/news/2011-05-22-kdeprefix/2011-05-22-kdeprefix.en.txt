This news item is relevant to you only if you unmasked and enabled
kdeprefix useflag on your kde-base packages.

On 2011-06-06, kdeprefix support will be removed from all KDE ebuilds in
portage.  After this is done, only one version of KDE SC will be able to
be installed at a time on a system.  If you are currently using
USE=kdeprefix to install multiple versions of KDE SC simultaneously, you
will need to migrate to a non-kdeprefix installation.

To migrate, you will need to set USE=-kdeprefix (or remove the manual
unmasking of that flag in /etc/portage/profile) and rebuild all of the
installed packages in kde-base/.  To reinstall these packages, you can
run: emerge --update --deep --newuse @world
