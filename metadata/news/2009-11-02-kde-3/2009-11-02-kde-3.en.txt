After multiple setbacks we have finally managed to stabilise KDE4 on
both major desktop architectures (amd64 and x86), with other teams to
follow.

For this and other reasons as discussed at [1], those of you who still 
use KDE3 should be seriously considering an upgrade in the near future.

KDE3 is currently being phased out of the tree, meaning ebuilds with
KDE3 support found to be broken or clashing with KDE4 features are having
that support removed.

KDE3 packages will be moved to a special overlay named kde-sunset.  
This can be found in layman.  [2] Note that this overlay is going to be
user maintained and will NOT be developer reviewed. [3]
