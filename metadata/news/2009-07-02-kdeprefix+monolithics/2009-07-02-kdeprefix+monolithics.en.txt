The Gentoo KDE Guide has been updated and now covers the two most
serious issues affecting KDE users:

1) masking of the kdeprefix USE flag for KDE 4 users and
2) the upgrade of KDE 3 and KOffice 1.6.3 due to stabilisation to KDE
3.5.10 and KOffice 1.6.3_p20090204 for users of monolithic ebuilds.

Please refer to the guide [0] to solve those issues.
